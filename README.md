Short reflection (5–10 sentences):

What worked,
What was hardest, 
What I would improve.

Most of the devices themselved were very cooperative with the code, I found that once the installs were completed properly, I had no issue ( I was very worried about burning devices, but my setup yieldde cooperative results. The hardest thing aboutthis project was the structure itself, setting up files in a way that followed instructions and allowed for proper code run. The DHT11 sensor gave many import troubles (sys / venv import confusion). I would improve on how the LEDS function. right now, the red one blinks when motion is sensed, teh green one blinked if the temperature drops below 20C-25C and teh blue one stays on to show the system is functional. I will soon add a 'party time option for the lights to be more dynamic.
