Short reflection (5–10 sentences):
What worked,
What was hardest, 
What I would improve.
Link to YouTube video (max 3 minutes) demonstrating:
    A concise system overview and your code’s structure (modules, main loop, MQTT client, logging).
    Executing the command on the Raspberry Pi to start your code (or show systemd status/start).
    The app running without exceptions.
    Local files being written with the correct date-stamped names and correct content format.
    Live data visible on Adafruit IO dashboard (sensor graphs updating, controls toggling actuators).
    Additionally, trigger a motion event and show alert + image capture. on the home security sensor
